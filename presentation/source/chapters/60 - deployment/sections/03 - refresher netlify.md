tagline:

Meet your new best friend!

~~~

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a **hosting service**. The tagline:

> Write frontend code. Push it. We handle the rest.

~~

It's not just a pure hosting service though - the beautiful thing is that it...

* **integrates with Github**
* can **publish a subdirectory**
* knows Node and can **run build scripts**

...which all seems like an **excellent fit** for our setup!
