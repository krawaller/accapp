The course is divided into several **chapters**, where you're currently in the first.

![index and chapters](resources/diagrams/course-structure.svg)

We access the chapters from an **index**, giving you a **birds-eye view** of the entire contents.

~~

Each **chapter** has many **sections**:

~~

In the **PDF** and in the **presentation top-right corner**, the slides are numbered **`X‑Y‑Z`** where...

* `X` is the number of the current **chapter**
* `Y` is the number of the section **section** within that chapter
* `Z` is the number of the **slide** within that section

~~~

Some sections are **exercises**, where you'll get to internalise what we've been talking about through a 
**practical task**.

Because **accelerated learning** and all that.
