Synchronizing expectations for the course

~~

So - for the next 3 days, we'll talk about

* **JS app development**
* ...but we'll splice in some **general JS fu**...
* ...including the **build step**,
* ...leading up to **AngularJS**,
* ...and lots of stuff in between

~~~

My **unofficial goal** is that you should be able to **chat up a web developer in a bar**.

...or **survive an interview without faux pas**, whichever you find more interesting.

~~~

* It is **forbidden to keep a question to yourself**. Ask away! Because,
* **there are no stupid questions**. <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>Only stupid people.</span>
