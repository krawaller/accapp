(There was also a dark time when **Java applets** were used in webpages, but we don't talk about that...)

(And we don't acknowledge the existence of **flash** either)

Traditionally, **web apps looked like this**:

Web tech was **just the UI**. The real coding was done in `php` / `ruby` / `java` / `.NET`.

Additionally, web tech has **escaped from the browser**:

And blurring the lines even further - there are framework to **compile web to native code**:

In essence: **web tech is on the (high) rise**, and even if you intend to stay in a sheltered C# garden, knowledge about the web platform will serve you well.
