<div class="goal"></div>

Before we can get started for real we must make sure that you're **adequately equipped**!

~~~

This isn't really an exercise as such, just me telling you to **install a bunch of stuff**.

We won't talk about **what the stuff does here**, that'll come later!

~~~

list)

We're going to ensure we have the following installed:

* Node
* Python
* Git
* Visual Studio Code
* MDN (not a program, but a tool nontheless!)

If you already have some/all of it, simply skip that instruction!

~~~

item)

First we install *NodeJS*!

![](resources/images/node.jpg)

Surf over to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

~~ 

You'll get to **choose between "Recommended" and "Latest"**:

![](resources/images/nodeversions.png)

It doesn't really matter, but you can **pick "Recommended"**.

~~

When you go through the installer, it is important that you **make Node available in the terminals**!

This option is usually a checkbox called something like "Add to path", or "Add to environment variables".

~~~

item)

Next up - **Python**!

Surf to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

~~~

Again there is a **choice between versions**:

![](resources/images/pythonversions.png)

You can **select the latest** which is 3, but if you already have 2 installed, that's ok too.

~~

And also like Node, we must **make Python available in the terminals**!

Same thing again: This option is usually a checkbox called something like "Add to path", or "Add to environment variables".

~~ 

item)

Now, time for **Git**!

<div class="whitebg">
![](resources/images/git.png)
</div>

You likely already have it, but if not, get it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

~~~

And, same as before, we must **make Git available in the terminals** by checking the relevant box in the installation.

~~~

item)

Finally we need to install **Visual Studio Code**.

![](resources/images/vsc.png)

Get it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

~~~

question)

But, I want to use `SomeOtherEditor` instead!

~~~

answer)

Tough luck! :)

~~~

Serious answer: You're welcome to use whatever you want, but throughout these days I'll provide support for VSC.

~~~

item)

Finally we need to have access to a **reference**! We recommend [Mozilla Developer Networks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (or MDN for short), which generally is better than the more-well-known W3Schools.

Surf to [https://developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org) and explore for a bit!

<div class="checklist"></div>

You are done when...

* You can type `python --version` in any terminal
* You can type `git --version` in any terminal
* You can type `node --version` in any terminal
* You have VSC installed (or cling on to sth else)
* You've familiarised yourself with MDN
