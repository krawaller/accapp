On this journey, our primary tool is **a browser**. I primarily use Chrome, but any modern browser will do.

This is not just for consuming web content - the **developer tools** inside the browser is an integral part of our setup. Consider it part of our IDE without the I!

~~~

Another very useful function in the browser is to be able to **view source**. All web apps transmit their entire source code to the browser, so snoop away!

~~~

We also need an **editor**. As HTML, CSS and JavaScript isn't (necessarily) compiled, any text editor can be used, but preferrably one with **good web tooling**.

Why not **VSC**?


~~~

There is an **ongoing religious war** between whether **IDE:s or editors** are the optimum. You don't have to take sides (although as VC slaves you likely already have), but it is good to understand the problem to be able to form an opinion.

~~~

You'll need to install **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, if you haven't already done so.

Instructions will follow later, so hold on for now!

~~~

Later on we might need a **web server**, and a local installation of **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** is a supremely convenient way of accomplishing this.

~~~

Just navigate to your main projects folder in a terminal and type:

* `python -m http.server` for Python 3
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` for python 2

...and voila, all your projects are published at `http://localhost:8000`!

But, we'll get to this too down the road.

~~~

Finally you need a **good resources** for looking up specifics. I recommend Mozilla Developer Network, or **MDN** for short.

Find it at [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

~~~

I do **NOT recomment W3Schools**, who will be at the top of every googling. They are good at SEO, not explanations and documentations.

I suggest either

* **blocking them from google results**, or 
* **prefixing your queries with MDN**

~~~

Whichever resource you use, it is important to **have somewhere within reach to go for details**. 

Therefore, choose a resource and **invest time in getting to know it** and know it well, so that future lookups go quick.
