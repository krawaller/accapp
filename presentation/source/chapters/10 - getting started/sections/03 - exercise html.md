Goal: Make **HTML** and **CSS** to show a **movie review** page

~

TODO - screenshot

~

list)

Here's the battle plan

* create a **project folder**
* add **html file**
* add **css file**

~

item)

Create **folder** somewhere to host our movie review project. Open that folder in Visual Studio Code.

~~

item)

Add a new file called **`index.html`**.

![](resources/images/vcs-createfile.png)

~~

Make VSC give you a **base to start** by entering...

```
html:5
```

...at the top of the file and then **hit tab**.

~~~

Now **flesh out the document** with the HTML needed to get the same contents as in the screenshot!

For stars, use **this SVG file**. TODO - link

Link an image, steal online TODO - more instructions

~~Â 

item)

Time to add a **coat of paint**!

Create a new file in our folder called **`styles.css`**.

Connect it via a **link element in `index.html`**.

~~

Now add some CSS here to...

* make the site **centered vertically**
* **size the image** so it isn't too big or small
* make the **first 3 stars be filled**
* tweak the rest if you want!

~~

<div class="checklist"></div>

You are done when...

* double-clicking `index.html` shows the review in a browser
* it looks ok
