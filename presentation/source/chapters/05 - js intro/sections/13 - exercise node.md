Goal: Have NodeJS installed locally on your machine

~

Goto https://nodejs.org/

Download the "Current Version"

~

Click through the installer.

Make sure to, when given the choice, check that you want to **Add Node to path** (might be phrased slightly differently)

~

You'll see that node has installed a few things in the start menu:

All of these are a bit useless, just use node and npm directly.

You are done when...

* typing `node -v` in any terminal works
