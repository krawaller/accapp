* [Stage 0 list](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) (23)
* [Stage 1-3](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) (26, 7, 16)
* [Stage 4](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) (7, not counting ES2016)

A **recommended learning resource** if you want to become a nerd are these books by Alex Rauschmayer:

* [Exploring ES6](https://leanpub.com/exploring-es6)
* [Exploring ES2016 and ES2017](https://leanpub.com/exploring-es2016-es2017)

Both are **free online**. And I've brought paper copies for you to peruse!
