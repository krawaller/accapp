So - **JavaScript**! It is a different beast in many ways:

* loose typing
* functional focus
* prototypal "inheritance"

item)

At its core, loose typing means the following **deal with the devil**: 

We get **extreme power and [flexibility](http://js1k.com/)**, at the cost of **tooling**.

~~~

Although, with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) we can cheat the devil!

~~~

item)

Functions are first class citizens in JavaScript, meaning they're a **value like any other**.

This means it lends itself to **functional programming techniques**, which are growing evermore popular. We'll come back to those!

~~~

item)

Being stuck in an OOP mindframe, we think a lot about **inheritance**. JavaScript has inheritance of sorts, but **between "instances"**.

But - in JavaScript, **inheritance doesn't matter much**.

~~~

By the way - are you familiar with the **3 levels of programming**?

question)


They were interesting, but **what do they have to do with JavaScript**?

~~

answer)


JavaScript's flexible nature **encourages and empowers level 2 behaviour**.

So **take good care**, and remember:

> With great power comes great responsibility
