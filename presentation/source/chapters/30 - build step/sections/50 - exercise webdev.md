Goal: Hook in webpack dev server

~~

Not much else to say - we want to have **webpack dev server** available in our build step!

~~~

You thereby need to...

* install it
* add configuration
* add a script
* hook up a notifier

...all of which you can find instructions for in the previous section.

~~

<div class="checklist"></div>

You are done when...

* There is a working `start:dev` script
* You are notified upon rebuild

~~

If you get stuck, see the [Webpack Dev](https://github.com/krawaller/js-app-solutions/tree/master/webpack_dev) solution.
